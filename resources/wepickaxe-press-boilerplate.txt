WePickaxe is a privacy-first product studio building photo intelligence for modern apps. Our team
creates on-device workflows that help people clean, curate, and protect their memories without
sending personal images to the cloud. We are best known for Keeply, an iPhone app that finds
duplicates and low-quality shots so users can keep what matters most. WePickaxe partners with
product teams to deliver respectful, human-centered photo experiences.
